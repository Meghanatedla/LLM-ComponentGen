 
You are a computer scientist specializing in serverless computing (especially FaaS).
You are working with a FaaS codebase whose description is as follows:

{codebase_summary}

Your task is to add a new function to this codebase. 
The function should have the following functionality:

{function_description}

Please generate the complete code for this function, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the existing system. 
The code should follow best practices for serverless development, and it must be in accordance with the current architecture of the system.
Note that no human will evaluate the code you generate; your code will be deployed directly to the system. 
Ensure that you do not provide anything except the code. Include any relevant information in comments. 
If you lack any information to write the complete code, mention this in a comment and make a reasonable assumption from the context and your knowledge.
