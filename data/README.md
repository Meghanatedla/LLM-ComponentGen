[The csv in this folder](ComponentGenDataset.csv) contains the URL, commit hash, serverless function filenames and other details of the repositories and serverless functions chosen for generation. Clone the repositories at the given commit hash to access the code during the time of this study. Use the [prompt templates](../experiments/prompt-templates/) when creating the prompts for the different LLMs used in the [notebook](../experiments/runner.ipynb). A copy of the original and generated serverless functions and the corresponding prompts are already in the corresponding directories in the [experiments folder](../experiments/) for each repository (see the [main README](../README.md) for the project structure.)
